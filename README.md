# Ollama Chat UI: A Minimalist Interactive Conversational Interface
==============================================

## Project Title
------------------

Ollama Chat UI is a minimalist interactive conversational interface built using Python and PyQt6. This project aims to provide a simple yet effective way to engage with AI models like LLaMA.

## Description
---------------

I built this project to experiment with the possibilities of creating a user-friendly interface for interacting with large language models (LLMs). The Ollama Chat UI takes advantage of the [Llama3](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ollama/llama3) model, which is a state-of-the-art AI chatbot that can generate human-like responses.

## Features
------------

*   A simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt6
*   Support for basic interactions like asking questions, sending messages, and exiting the conversation
*   Integration with the Llama3 model to generate human-like responses
*   Robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience
*   Code organization and structure inspired by best practices

One cool feature is the **ModelPullThread** class, which enables asynchronous communication with the LLaMA API. This allows for efficient handling of requests and responses, making the chat interface responsive and interactive.

I'm thinking about adding features like:

*   Real-time language translation
*   Integration with other AI models (e.g., [LLaMA-Tiny](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ollama/llama-tiny))
*   Support for multiple chat sessions

## Installation
---------------

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasnocool/ollama-chat-ui.git
cd ollama-chat-ui
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: This project requires Python 3.8 or later.

## Usage
---------

1.  Run the `main.py` file using Python:
    ```bash
python main.py
    ```
2.  Interact with the chat interface by typing messages in the input field and clicking the "Send" button.
3.  Enjoy conversing with LLaMA!
